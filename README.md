# Flashcard App Assessment
This app was created using React and Bootstrap for the Thinkful Software Developer Certification curriculum and should not be copied or duplicated.

## Capabilities
This app allows the user to create and study decks of flashcards by fetching from and posting to an API server included in the project. **npm run start** will start the app and the server simultaneously.

## Important Note
The API server is hosted locally alongside the app itself. The corresponding localhost port can be changed within utils/api/index.js. The app currently looks for a server located on [Link](http://localhost:8080).
